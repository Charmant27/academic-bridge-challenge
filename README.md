## TODO
This is a simple todo web application. this application is built under ReactJS and TailwindCSS for styling. it is not yet a fully functional application, there are some dummy data like users on a todo task. however, all the todos including their numbers based on filter are coming from [dummy todo api](https://dummyjson.com/todos). this application can be translated from french to english vice versa. users can switch from light mode to dark mode depending on their preferences. it is accessible on any type of devices. this project can be developed and maintained later by adding other features like authentication.
